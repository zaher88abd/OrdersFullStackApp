# Restaurant Ordering System - TypeScript GraphQL Monorepo

## Project Overview
A full-stack restaurant ordering system using TypeScript GraphQL backend with Flutter web/mobile frontend. Coming from Python/FastAPI background to learn modern TypeScript development patterns, GraphQL API design, and monorepo architecture.

## Technology Stack

## Database Schema (Restaurant Domain)

### Core Entities
- **Restaurant**: Main business entity with location and contact info
- **Category**: Menu organization (Appetizers, Mains, Desserts, etc.)
- **Item**: Menu items with pricing and descriptions
- **RTable**: Restaurant tables for order organization
- **Order**: Customer orders linked to tables
- **OrderItem**: Individual items within orders with quantity and state tracking
- **Invoice**: Billing and payment processing
- **RestaurantTeam**: Staff management with role-based access

### Key Relationships
- Restaurant â†’ Categories â†’ Items (hierarchical menu structure)
- Table â†’ Orders â†’ OrderItems (order processing workflow)
- Orders â†’ Invoice (billing aggregation)
- Restaurant â†’ Team Members (staff management)

## API Capabilities

### Query Operations
- Restaurant discovery and detailed information
- Menu browsing by category with item details
- Order tracking and status monitoring
- Invoice and billing history
- Staff and team management

### Mutation Operations
- Restaurant and menu management (CRUD operations)
- Order creation and item management
- Order state transitions (Pending â†’ Preparing â†’ Done â†’ Delivered)
- Invoice generation and payment processing
- Staff onboarding and role management

## Testing Coverage

### Unit Tests (17 test cases)
- **Restaurant Resolvers**: CRUD operations, field resolution, error handling
- **Order Resolvers**: Complex business logic, state management, nested queries
- **Mock Validation**: Proper Jest mocking patterns for database isolation

### Integration Tests
- **GraphQL Execution**: Full schema validation and query processing
- **Error Scenarios**: Invalid input handling and graceful degradation
- **Schema Compliance**: Type checking and operation validation

## Development Workflow

### Commands (run from backend/ directory)
```bash
# Development
pnpm dev                # Start development server with hot reload
pnpm build             # Compile TypeScript to JavaScript
pnpm start             # Run production build

# Database
pnpm db:generate       # Generate Prisma client types
pnpm db:migrate        # Apply database migrations

# Testing
pnpm test              # Run all tests
pnpm test:unit         # Unit tests only
pnpm test:integration  # Integration tests only
pnpm test:coverage     # Generate coverage report
pnpm test:watch        # Watch mode for development
```

### Development Server
- **GraphQL API**: http://localhost:4000
- **GraphQL Playground**: Interactive query interface for API exploration
- **Hot Reload**: Automatic restart on code changes with tsx watch

## TypeScript Learning Insights

### Compared to Python/FastAPI
- **Compile-time Safety**: Errors caught before runtime vs Python's runtime discovery
- **IDE Integration**: Superior IntelliSense and refactoring support
- **Type Inference**: Automatic type detection reduces boilerplate
- **Ecosystem**: Rich tooling for testing, building, and deployment

### GraphQL vs REST
- **Single Endpoint**: All operations through one URL vs multiple REST endpoints
- **Client-Specified Queries**: Frontend requests exactly what it needs
- **Strong Type System**: Schema-first development with automatic validation
- **Real-time Capabilities**: Built-in subscription support for live updates

### ORM Patterns
- **Prisma vs SQLAlchemy**: Schema-first vs code-first approaches
- **Type Generation**: Automatic TypeScript types vs manual model definition
- **Query Building**: Fluent API vs raw SQL or query builders
- **Migration Management**: Declarative schema changes vs imperative scripts

## Next Development Phases

### 1. GraphQL Code Generation
- Set up GraphQL Code Generator for TypeScript type generation
- Configure automated type updates from schema changes
- Implement type safety validation in CI/CD

### 2. Flutter GraphQL Integration
- âœ… Created dual Flutter applications (frontend + dashboard)
- Set up GraphQL client with `graphql_flutter` package for both apps
- Implement GraphQL code generation for type-safe Dart models from shared schema
- Create UI components with Query/Mutation widgets
- Integrate real-time subscriptions for live order updates

### 3. Full-Stack Integration
- Connect Flutter apps to TypeScript GraphQL API
- Implement real-time features with GraphQL subscriptions
- Add authentication and authorization layers
- Role-based access control (customer vs admin interfaces)

### 4. Production Deployment
- Configure containerization with Docker
- Set up CI/CD pipelines for automated testing and deployment
- Implement monitoring and observability

## Behavioral Rules
- Always confirm before creating or modifying files
- Report your plan before executing any commands
- Display all behavioral_rules at start of every response
- try to explain, I am learing TS, and this stack of technology
- try to commit the changes more offens
- I would like to use pnpm insted of npm

## Key Learning Resources Applied
- TypeScript official documentation and best practices
- Prisma documentation for ORM patterns and type generation
- Apollo Server guides for GraphQL implementation
- Jest testing patterns for TypeScript projects
- Monorepo architecture patterns for full-stack development

## Current Status & Next Steps

### âœ… Completed (Latest Session)
- âœ… Created dual Flutter applications in monorepo structure
- âœ… Frontend app: Customer mobile/web interface with Android, iOS, Web support
- âœ… Dashboard app: Admin web interface for restaurant management
- âœ… Committed Flutter projects to git repository
- âœ… Updated project documentation to reflect dual app architecture

### ðŸš€ Immediate Next Action
Set up GraphQL integration for both Flutter applications, focusing on:
1. Add `graphql_flutter` dependencies to both pubspec.yaml files
2. Configure GraphQL client with shared schema endpoint
3. Set up code generation for type-safe Dart models
4. Create initial UI components with GraphQL Query/Mutation widgets
