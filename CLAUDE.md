## Development Workflow

### Commands (run from backend/ directory)
```bash
# Development
pnpm dev                # Start development server with hot reload
pnpm build             # Compile TypeScript to JavaScript
pnpm start             # Run production build

# Database
pnpm db:generate       # Generate Prisma client types
pnpm db:migrate        # Apply database migrations

# Testing
pnpm test              # Run all tests
pnpm test:unit         # Unit tests only
pnpm test:integration  # Integration tests only
pnpm test:coverage     # Generate coverage report
pnpm test:watch        # Watch mode for development
```

### Development Server

- **Ecosystem**: Rich tooling for testing, building, and deployment

### GraphQL vs REST
- **Single Endpoint**: All operations through one URL vs multiple REST endpoints
- **Client-Specified Queries**: Frontend requests exactly what it needs
- **Strong Type System**: Schema-first development with automatic validation
- **Real-time Capabilities**: Built-in subscription support for live updates

### ORM Patterns
- **Prisma vs SQLAlchemy**: Schema-first vs code-first approaches
- **Type Generation**: Automatic TypeScript types vs manual model definition
- **Query Building**: Fluent API vs raw SQL or query builders
- **Migration Management**: Declarative schema changes vs imperative scripts

## Next Development Phases
