# OrdersAPI TypeScript

A modern GraphQL API built with TypeScript, Prisma ORM, and Apollo Server for learning backend development patterns.

## Overview

This project demonstrates building a type-safe API using modern TypeScript tools and practices. It's designed as a learning exercise to understand the integration between database schema management, type-safe ORM operations, and GraphQL API development.

## Technology Stack

- **TypeScript** - Static typing for JavaScript
- **Prisma** - Type-safe ORM and database client
- **Apollo Server** - GraphQL server implementation
- **PostgreSQL/MySQL** - SQL database (to be determined)

## Current Status

### âœ… Completed
- Project structure setup
- TypeScript configuration
- Prisma ORM integration
- Apollo Server GraphQL setup
- Database schema design
- Basic resolver implementation

### ðŸ“‹ Learning Objectives
- Understanding TypeScript fundamentals for backend development
- Mastering Prisma ORM concepts and type safety
- Learning Apollo Server and GraphQL patterns
- Implementing end-to-end type safety from database to client

## Getting Started

1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Set up your database connection in `.env`

3. Run Prisma migrations:
   ```bash
   npx prisma migrate dev
   ```

4. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

## Development Notes

This project serves as a practical learning exercise transitioning from Python/FastAPI to modern TypeScript backend development. The focus is on understanding type safety, ORM patterns, and GraphQL API design.
